            If you have learnt any form of Indian dance years ago and feel the urge to get back in touch and 
            dance away your stress, look no further. This is what Kaladhaara's newest initiative is all about!
             SacAdavu meetup is a group of like minded dancers who meet bi monthly on a weeknd morning to 
             revisit the foundation, technique and learn something new every time. The approach is similar 
             to a drop in dance class.
        </p>
        <p className='mt-8 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-600'>
            This is a collaborative work space that allows for dancers in the 
            area to learn, grow and enjoy this beautiful art form. Every session starts with a  slow warm up,
            a few adavus that focuses on form and technique and is followed with a short choreography. 
            The session concludes with some stretches and relaxed conversations about anything and everything. 
            If you want to energize your weekend with some “me time”, hop aboard the SacAdavu meetup train!
